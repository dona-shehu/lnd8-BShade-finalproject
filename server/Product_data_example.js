Galbani Burrata will take your love for mozzarella to the next level. Originating from the Apulia region in Southern Italy, Burrata is one of Italy's most beloved cheeses. It is mozzarella formed into a pouch and filled with cream and ribbons of mozzarella that give it a delicious soft texture. Galbani Burrata has a mild, smooth and fresh milk flavour that makes it very versatile. Enjoy it with moist tomatoes, basil, crusty bread and a drizzle of olive oil for the ultimate Italian taste experience. You can also serve Burrata in pasta, pizza or simply have it on its own with seasoning. The best way to fully taste the flavours of Burrata is to enjoy it at an ambient temperature.
Galbani® is Italy's favourite cheesemaker, producing many of Italy's most loved cheeses since 1882.
