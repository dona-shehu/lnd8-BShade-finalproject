It would have been more logical, since this product was both invented and manufactured in Landskrona, Sweden. And even though this amazing stuff is used in the same way as Greek yogurt, it is far from Greek yogurt — theoretically, even further from the yogurt part than from the Greek part, since it is completely free of dairy, while the Greek city of Thessaloniki is only 2,399 kilometres from our factory in Landskrona. Of course all of this is really, really far off from what we are here to tell you about on this webpage which is that Oatgurt Greek Style has a thick, smooth and creamy texture combined with a fresh and pleasantly sour flavour. Not to brag, but this is among the best* products we have ever created, if not the best webpage copy.",
